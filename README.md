In modern agricultural monitoring, self-powered systems are more and more recommended. However, there is no detailed research on the monitoring strategy of self-powered systems for different plants and different battery costs. Taking Dallas as an example, this paper studies and compares the trade-off between different duty cycles and batteries of self-powered systems by using the weather data of precipitation rate in Dallas. Finally, we explore a relationship between duty cycle, battery capacity, and precipitation threshold; that is, flowers with different temperature/humidity sensitivity can find the corresponding working mode switching strategy under different battery capacities.

Model.py is used to create a class for generating rainy value and sunny value.

ThreeDimensionPlot.py is used to draw 3D plot model which shows the relationship between rainy duty cycle, batteey capacity and rainy value.

Instantiation.py is used to instantiate the model.
